BEGIN

Before starting make sure you:
- you can get an IP and surf via your ethernet jack.
- you can get an IP and surf via your wireless card. Use the Network manager gui to connect to your wifi network.

Now let's get dirty.

Disable Network manager.  This will kill your internet so have all your notes loaded up on another computer or your phone/tablet.

sudo stop network-manager
echo "manual" | sudo tee /etc/init/network-manager.override

Setup Static IP for eth0

sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
$ cat /etc/network/interfaces
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.111
	gateway 192.168.1.1
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	network 192.168.1.0
	broadcast 192.168.1.255
	dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1

reboot to really test it:
sudo reboot

Now that eth0 static is working, let's setup wlan0

Setup Static IP for wlan0

[OPTIONAL: setup wlan0 first with dhcp... might be easier to sort out than going straight to static]


sudo vi /etc/init.d/networking
# wireless
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-ssid "[myssid]"
wpa-psk "[mypass]"


reboot (pull out the cat5 cable to ensure you're testing the wifi)

If that works, move on to static test:
sudo vi /etc/init.d/networking

# wireless
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
	wpa-ssid "[myssid]"
	wpa-psk "[mypass]"
        address 192.168.1.112
        gateway 192.168.1.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.1.0
        broadcast 192.168.1.255
        dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1

reboot (pull out the cat5 cable to ensure you're testing the wifi)


So now eth0 and wlan0 both work.  Before proceeding, copy /etc/network/interfaces to a safe place!
eg: cp /etc/network/interfaces ~/backupfiles/interfaces.good

sudo apt-get install ifenslave

Add "bonding" to /etc/modules

Should look something like this:
$ sudo cat /etc/modules
# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
#
# This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
# at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
# Parameters can be specified after the module name.

rtc
bonding


sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces to configure network interfaces.

$ cat /etc/network/interfaces 
auto lo eth0 wlan0 bond0

iface lo inet loopback

iface eth0 inet manual
bond-master bond0
bond-primary eth0 wlan0

iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-ssid "[myssid]"
wpa-psk "[mypass]"
bond-master bond0
bond-primary eth0 wlan0

iface bond0 inet static
bond_mode active-backup
bond-miimon 100
bond-primary eth0
slaves eth0 wlan0
address 192.168.1.113
gateway 192.168.1.1
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.1.0
broadcast 192.168.1.255
dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1

Some verification and trouble shooting commands:
